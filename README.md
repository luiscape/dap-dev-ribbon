OCHA Dev Ribbon 
===============

Ribbon for DAP development sites.

It should look like this: 

![alt tag](https://raw2.github.com/luiscape/ocha-dev-ribbon/master/screen_grab.png)

Usage 
-----

Just copy and paste one of the following snipped into the page's HTML: 

```html

<!-- Left hand-side ribbon. -->
<a href="#"><img style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; border: 0;" src="ocha-dev-ribbon-left.png" alt="This is a DEVELPMENT page."></a>


<!-- Right hand-side ribbon. -->
<a href="#"><img style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; border: 0;" src="ocha-dev-ribbon-right.png" alt="This is a DEVELPMENT page."></a>


```

Make sure to change the link to a to-be-created page that explains why the page visited is a development page and other details. The image link should also be updated to the DAP servers. 

Take a look at the `test.html` file file for a brief example.
